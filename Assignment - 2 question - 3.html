    <title>Datatypes</title>
    <h3>
        <h2>There are Eight datatypes in javascript. They are:</h2>
        <h3>1. undefined</h3>
        <h3>2. boolean</h3>
        <h3>3. Number</h3>
        <h3>4. String</h3>
        <h3>5. null</h3>
        <h3>6. Symbol</h3>
        <h3>7. object</h3>
        <h3>8. BigInt</h3>
        <h3>
            Number - The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

            There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
            
            Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
            
            Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number. So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            BigInt - In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(-253-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.

            For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.
            
            BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
            
            A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:

        <h3>
            String - A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

            1. Double quotes: "Hello".
            2. Single quotes: 'Hello'.
            3. Backticks: `Hello`.
            Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
            
            Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Boolean - The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

            This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Null - The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value.In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Undefined - The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null. The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”. Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable, But we don’t recommend doing that. Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Object - The object type is special.

            All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
            
            Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We’ll deal with them later in the chapter Objects, after we learn more about primitives.
        </h3>
        <h3> 
            Symbol - The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.
