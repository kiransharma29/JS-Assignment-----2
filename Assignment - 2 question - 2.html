        difference between var, let and const

        var is used to declare the variables, and the scope of the declared variables is global i.e,it can be accessed from anywhere.
        let is also used to declare variables but the variables declared with let will have local scope because these variables are declared inside a block of code.
        The variables declared with const cannot be modified, if once declared.
        This is the difference between var, let and const and the examples for var, let and code are written below

     document.write("</br>");
    }
    document.write("this is the value of 'a' outside let"," ", a);
    document.write("</br>")
    //const means constant and the variables declared with const cannot be interpreted or we cannot modify the values once it is assigned
